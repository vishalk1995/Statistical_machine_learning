#Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms For Histopathological Cancer Detection

One of the many great things about Machine learning research is that due to its
inherent general nature, its probable applications is very extensive. One of the
possible directions in which we can invest is Medicine. Being able to program the
detection of metastasized cancer in pathological images with machine learning is
an area of medical imaging and diagnostics with promising potential for clinical
utility[22]. Early diagnosis can increase the chance of successful treatment and
survival. However, it is a very challenging and time-consuming task that relies on
the experience of pathologists. The automatic diagnosis of cancer by analyzing
histopathological images plays a substantial role for patients and their prognosis.
Moreover, the ability of ML to perceive key features from complex datasets reveals
their significance. So, we developed ML algorithms to identify metastatic cancer
in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans and conducted
a comparative study between traditional machine learning technique and Deep
Learning.
